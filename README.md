# About the challenge
In this challenge we are going to practice more than 30 days of coding for Android application development with Saumya Singh. 

## Day 1
The first step in becoming an Android developer is to familiarize yourself with the primary development environment, Android Studio. Android Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed by Google for building Android applications. You can download and install Android Studio from the official website for free. On the first day, you can take a tour of the interface, learn about the various tools and features, and start playing around with the code editor.

## Day 2
Android development is done using Kotlin, so it's essential to have a good understanding of the language. For the next few days, focus on learning the basics of Kotlin programming. This includes variables, data types, operators, control structures, arrays, loops, and more.

## Day 3
Once you have a good understanding of Java, you can start building your first Android app.
