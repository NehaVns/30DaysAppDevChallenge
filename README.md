# About the challenge
In this challenge we are going to practice more than 30 days of coding for Android application development with Saumya Singh. 

## Day 1
The first step in becoming an Android developer is to familiarize yourself with the primary development environment, Android Studio. Android Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed by Google for building Android applications. You can download and install Android Studio from the official website for free. On the first day, you can take a tour of the interface, learn about the various tools and features, and start playing around with the code editor.

## Day 2
Android development is done using Kotlin, so it's essential to have a good understanding of the language. For the next few days, focus on learning the basics of Kotlin programming. This includes variables, data types, operators, control structures, arrays, loops, and more.

## Day 3
Once you have a good understanding of Java, you can start building your first Android app.<br>
The first app we built was named as <a href="https://github.com/NehaVns/30DaysAppDevChallenge/tree/main/First Demo App" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FirstDemoApp</a>.

## Day 4-6
Now that you have a basic understanding of Android app development, it's time to focus on the user interface (UI). You will learn how to create and design the UI using XML layout files, how to add buttons, text fields, and other UI elements to your app, and how to respond to user interactions.

## Day 7
During our session, we acquired knowledge about Text View and Scroll View, and proceeded to create a basic user interface while also exploring the different layout features available. <br>
You can find the app here: <a href="https://github.com/NehaVns/30DaysAppDevChallenge/tree/main/ScrollView" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Scroll View</a>.

## Day 8-9
So from now onwards we started focussing on the Intents inside android studio. There are two of them but we started with the Explicit one. An activity is a specific screen or user interface within an Android app, and an explicit intent is used to launch a specific activity directly, without relying on any system defaults or implicit behaviors.<br>
Find the source code here:  <a href="https://github.com/NehaVns/30DaysAppDevChallenge/tree/main/ExplicitIntent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Explicit Intent</a>.

## Day 10
Implicit intents are a little difficult to work with initially because we are not very well aware of the different functionalities it provides for different android applications inside our mobile phones. <br>
An example demostrating this is:  <a href="https://github.com/NehaVns/30DaysAppDevChallenge/tree/main/ImplicitIntent" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Implicit Intent</a>.

## Day 11
The video focusses on the one of the very important concepts of android developement - <a href="https://github.com/NehaVns/30DaysAppDevChallenge/tree/main/WebView" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Webview</a>.

## Day 12
Developing your first application all by yourself can be a challenging and rewarding experience. I learned a lot and am proud of what I have accomplished. To see what kind of application I built, 𝗰𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸 𝗼𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗮𝘁: <a href="https://github.com/NehaVns/30DaysAppDevChallenge/tree/main/KnowledgeHub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Knowledge Hub</a>.

## Day 13
Here we passed data from one activity to another. The orders given by the customer is available onto the next screen <a href="https://github.com/NehaVns/30DaysAppDevChallenge/tree/main/MyCafe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">My Cafe</a>. 

## Day 14
It was all about how to understand Logcat and other error resolution techniques.

## Day 16
We have finally started with Firebase in our application <a href="https://github.com/NehaVns/30DaysAppDevChallenge/tree/main/FirebaseDatabase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Firebase Database</a>. <br>
Here we are just designing the SignUp Screen and storing the user information in the Firebase.

## Day 17
We have extended the previous application, adding the Login page, by reading the data from the Firebase

## Day 18
Concepts regarding view binding are discussed. It is very useful to link layout components as compared to findViewById.
