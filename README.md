# About the challenge
In this challenge we are going to practice more than 30 days of coding for Android application development with Saumya Singh. 

## Day 1
The first step in becoming an Android developer is to familiarize yourself with the primary development environment, Android Studio. Android Studio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) developed by Google for building Android applications. You can download and install Android Studio from the official website for free. On the first day, you can take a tour of the interface, learn about the various tools and features, and start playing around with the code editor.

## Day 2
Android development is done using Kotlin, so it's essential to have a good understanding of the language. For the next few days, focus on learning the basics of Kotlin programming. This includes variables, data types, operators, control structures, arrays, loops, and more.

## Day 3
Once you have a good understanding of Java, you can start building your first Android app. The first app we built was named as <a href="https://github.com/NehaVns/30DaysAppDevChallenge/tree/main/FirstDemoApp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">FirstDemoApp</a>.

## Day 4-6
Now that you have a basic understanding of Android app development, it's time to focus on the user interface (UI). You will learn how to create and design the UI using XML layout files, how to add buttons, text fields, and other UI elements to your app, and how to respond to user interactions.

## Day 7
During our session, we acquired knowledge about Text View and Scroll View, and proceeded to create a basic user interface while also exploring the different layout features available. <br>
